logical pixel:
Logical pixels are roughly the same visual size across devices.

Physical pixel:
Physical pixels are the size of the actual hardware pixels on the device; 1/96 of an inch or 0.26mm.

The number of physical pixels per logical pixel is described by the devicePixelRatio.

Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) is the ratio between the physical pixel density of a device and its logical pixel density.
